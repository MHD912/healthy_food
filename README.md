# healthy Food

Healthy Food is a mobile application built with Flutter. I worked on this project during my training under the Mad_solutions team. 
Although this app doesn't have a fully functional UI, it covers most essential skills a Flutter developer should have, such as: 
  1. Identifying app UI elements, and implementing them efficiently with various Flutter widgets.
  2. State management with GetX with MVC architecture.
  3. RESTful API calls with Future widgets and asynchronous operations.
  4. Git Repository management, and more...
